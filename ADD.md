Got it—I’ve built movies.json from the Hallmark preview page and the Programming Guide PDF, and formatted it to your spec.  ￼  ￼ The dates/times/titles come from Hallmark’s 2025 “Countdown to Christmas” Preview and the official downloadable Programming Guide.  ￼

Download: movies.json

Notes:
	•	Movies are set to duration_minutes: 120; series/unscripted entries (e.g., Mistletoe Murders, Finding Mr. Christmas, Baked With Love: Holiday, Twelve Dates ’Til Christmas) are set to 60. You can tweak if you’d like exact runtimes.
	•	Times are converted from “8/7c, 6/5c, 9/8c” to 24-hour ET (20:00, 18:00, 21:00).
	•	season, start_date (2025-10-17) and end_date (2025-12-25) reflect this year’s event window.  ￼

If you want me to enrich with images/trailers or split out the weekly episodes for the series, say the word and I’ll extend the JSON accordingly.
